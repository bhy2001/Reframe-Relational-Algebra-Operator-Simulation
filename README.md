# Reframe Relational Algebra Operator Simulation

## Overview

This repository hosts the **Reframe Relational Algebra Operator Simulation** project, which is a tool designed to simulate and visualize relational algebra operations. It provides a hands-on approach for understanding the fundamental concepts of relational algebra, which is a core component of database management systems.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Perform and visualize various relational algebra operations such as selection, projection, union, intersection, and more.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Follow the execution of each operation in a step-by-step manner, helping users learn the logic behind each operator.
- **Custom Query Support**: Create and execute custom relational algebra queries on sample datasets.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and professionals seeking to deepen their understanding of relational algebra.

## Installation

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhy2001/Reframe-Relational-Algebra-Operator-Simulation.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Reframe-Relational-Algebra-Operator-Simulation
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Use the predefined functions with the CollegeDB dataset.
- Choose the relational algebra operations you want to simulate.
- Visualize the results and understand the intermediate steps.
